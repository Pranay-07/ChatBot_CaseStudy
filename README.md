# Hello World Program
A simple basic C# project with the code which prints "Hello World" in the console application

It has the test project included which checks whether it prints the desired output (*Hello world*)

This repo also has NUnit console runner tool, which can be used to run the test cases.

## Release notes

It has a batch file *AutoBuildTest.bat* which can be run to test the project after making any changes in the codes.

This batch file builds, runs and reports a pass-fail-status. It gives an exit-code of 0 for success and non-zero for failure. This exit-code needs to be a summary of all tests performed.
